# Domain Hunter

Forked from [threatexpress/domainhunter](https://github.com/threatexpress/domainhunter). Credits and thanks to them.

Domain name selection is an important aspect of preparation for penetration tests and especially Red Team engagements. Commonly, domains that were used previously for benign purposes and were properly categorized can be purchased for only a few dollars. Such domains can allow a team to bypass reputation based web filters and network egress restrictions for phishing and C2 related tasks. 

This Python based tool was written to quickly query the Expireddomains.net search engine for expired/available domains with a previous history of use. It then optionally queries for domain reputation against services like Symantec Site Review (BlueCoat), IBM X-Force, and Cisco Talos. The primary tool output is a timestamped HTML table style report.

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG) for history of updates and release notes!

## Features

- Retrieve specified number of recently expired and deleted domains (.com, .net, .org) from ExpiredDomains.net
- Note: You will need credentials from expireddomains.net for full functionality
- Retrieve available domains based on keyword search from ExpiredDomains.net
- Perform reputation checks against the Symantec WebPulse Site Review (BlueCoat), IBM x-Force, and Cisco Talos
- Sort results by domain age (if known) and filter for reputation
- Text-based table and HTML report output with links to reputation sources and Archive.org entry

## Installation

### Direct Installation

Install Python requirements

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
Optional - Install additional OCR support dependencies

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr python3-pil`

- MAC OSX: `brew install tesseract`

### pipenv installation

    pipenv --python 3.7
    pipenv install

Optional - Install additional OCR support dependencies

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr python3-pil`

## Configuration (optional)

To avoid passing some credentials in the command line, you can put them in a yaml configuration file. A good starting point is to copy the file [conf.yml.example](conf.yml.example) to `$HOME/.config/domainhunter/conf.yml` and fill it correctly. If you don't want to copy it to your config directory, you can set a filled file as the environment variable `DOMAIN_HUNTER_CONF`.
    
    Example:

    $ export DOMAIN_HUNTER_CONF=/path/to/filled/conf.yml
    $ python3 domainhunter.py ....

    # or on one line
    DOMAIN_HUNTER_CONF=/path/to/filled/conf.yml python3 domainhunter.py ....

## Usage

    usage: domainhunter.py [-h] [-a] [-k KEYWORD] [-c] [-f FILENAME] [--ocr]
                        [-r MAXRESULTS] [-s SINGLE] [-t {0,1,2,3,4,5}]
                        [-w MAXWIDTH] [-V]

    Finds expired domains, domain categorization, and Archive.org history to determine good candidates for C2 and phishing domains

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -a, --alexa           Filter results to Alexa listings
    -k KEYWORD, --keyword KEYWORD
                            Keyword used to refine search results
    -c, --check           Perform domain reputation checks
    -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                            Specify input file of line delimited domain names to
                            check
    --ocr                 Perform OCR on CAPTCHAs when challenged
    -r MAXRESULTS, --maxresults MAXRESULTS
                            Number of results to return when querying latest
                            expired/deleted domains
    -s SINGLE, --single SINGLE
                            Performs detailed reputation checks against a single
                            domain name/IP.
    -t {0,1,2,3,4,5}, --timing {0,1,2,3,4,5}
                            Modifies request timing to avoid CAPTCHAs. Slowest(0)
                            = 90-120 seconds, Default(3) = 10-20 seconds,
                            Fastest(5) = no delay
    -w MAXWIDTH, --maxwidth MAXWIDTH
                            Width of text table
    -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

    Examples:
    ./domainhunter.py -k apples -c --ocr -t5
    ./domainhunter.py --check --ocr -t3
    ./domainhunter.py --single mydomain.com
    ./domainhunter.py --keyword tech --check --ocr --timing 5 --alexa
    ./domaihunter.py --filename inputlist.txt --ocr --timing 5

Use defaults to check for most recent 100 domains and check reputation
    
    python3 ./domainhunter.py

Search for 1000 most recently expired/deleted domains, but don't check reputation

    python3 ./domainhunter.py -r 1000

Perform all reputation checks for a single domain

    python3 ./domainhunter.py -s mydomain.com
